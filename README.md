# installer_scripts
A set of scripts for installing & configuring Pharo (Linux & Windows packages)

### Pharo-Launcher Installer

This script automates the installation of `Pharo-Launcher` in Linux.  It does not rely on or take advantage of a cached PharoLauncher TGZ package; it assumes you have already downloaded a PharoLauncher zip file.

To use the PharoLauncher installer script, download a `PharoLauncher` zip file from https://pharo.org (32-bit or 64-bit) and copy it to the directory you wish to use for your Pharo projects; I use `~/Pharo`.  Then copy the `install-pharolauncher.sh` script into the same directory and run it.  When run without any arguments, it will print a comprehensive usage and quit.  Adding `-n` or `-u` will trigger the actual installation: `$ bash install-pharolauncher.sh -u` -- you will likely be prompted for your password to enable `sudo` (as it will want to install 32-bit support libraries on 64-bit Ubuntu systems, which will allow you to run 32-bit Pharo images).

The `install-pharolauncher.sh` script will create a `pharolauncher` directory in the same location as the script, then unzip the contents of the downloaded zip file into this new directory.  The script will also create a "launcher" file (a `.desktop` file) and install it; this launcher can be found by searching for `pharo` in the `Show Applications` panel of Gnome.  Clicking the launcher icon will launch the Pharo-Launcher application.

This script requires `sudo` privileges, and can be re-run without side-effects (although you will be prompted to overwrite files from a prior installation).

### Pharo-Adjust-Cursor

This script will edit the bash scripts that launch Pharo applications (i.e., `pharolauncher`, `pharoiot`, etc.) to either enable or disable enlarging the GUI pointer.  

This is useful on Linux systems with a 4K hi-DPI screen, since currently Pharo can enlarge its fonts and other GUI features, but not the cursor.

The cursor is enlarged by first setting an environment variable, `SQUEAK_FAKEBIGCURSOR`, to a non-zero value prior to running the application script (i.e., `pharo-launcher`, `pharo-ui`, etc.).  This script achieves this by editing the app scripts to add an `env` prefix to the commands that launch a Pharo virtual machine.

This script can edit the Pharo application scripts in both directions, to add the `env` prefix or remove it, depending on the option switch included on the command line.  There are no side-effects if the same command is issued multiple times in a row.  Each edit will create a backup file, with a name extension appended that reflects the script version backed up.  Restoring a backup must be done manually.

If run in a Pharo application directory (such as `pharolauncher`), this script will edit the Pharo scripts in just that directory.  If run in a directory that contains one or more Pharo app directories, it will search for and edit the scripts in each of them.  (If neither situation is met, it will complain, and will also complain if expected Pharo bash scripts aren't found.)

As is typical with my scripts (and most bash scripts), adding the `-h` switch (or `--help`) will show the usage prompt, as will entering the command with no arguments.
